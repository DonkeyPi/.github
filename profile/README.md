# DonkeyPi

The [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) is the poster child of the era of inexpensive and powerful SBCs we are living in. There are also fantastic software projects to make [firmware](https://nerves-project.org/), [web](https://www.phoenixframework.org/), and [graphics](https://github.com/ScenicFramework) development open, [enjoyable](https://elixir-lang.org/), affordable, and [reliable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BEAM_(Erlang_virtual_machine)).

DonkeyPi is a software effort to tackle some of the gaps in the available tooling in a minimalist, unpretentious, but opinionated way.

DonkeyPi consists of the following software components:

- A `runtime` to manage and interconnect process isolated applications
- A `CLI tooling` to deploy, monitor, script, and shell into running applications
- A `reactive` [TUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface) `library` to quicky craft single-page style user interfaces

Although the DonkeyPi Runtime is UI agnostic and can manage applications leveraging other UI technologies or no UIs at all, DonkeyPi aims at bringing the `text-based user interfaces` back to relevance for `lean` focused projects where `productivity` and `simplicity` are higher values.

DonkeyPi will initially focus on supporting the official Raspberry Pi 3 and 4 complemented with their 800x480 Touch Screen for development and didactic purposes as well as some [Compute Module based industrialized products](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wmotBc_SZ5M7TYrn8RQ1ZigbmCyBg4Yp-fNuVMBImHc/edit?usp=sharing) with similar specs for production projects.

The background of the DonkeyPi development team is in `industrial automation` as the use cases that will be initially put forward will clearly show. We are sure that more use cases will be identified as the community brings their own background and experience to the table.

There is a recurring metaphore in the industrial world (latam) to ask for a more affordable solution: *"You are proposing a ferrari but what we want is a beetle"*. DonkeyPi name comes from the animalistic version of that figure of speech. DonkeyPi aims at being a humble hard working reliable [donkey](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fEaDdmZbGrBeKiuU_7aS4qCZLn1ycegT_2RnZSmCmJQ/edit?usp=sharing) as opposed to a gorgeous [stallion](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fEaDdmZbGrBeKiuU_7aS4qCZLn1ycegT_2RnZSmCmJQ/edit?usp=sharing).
